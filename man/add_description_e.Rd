\describe{
  \item{panel}{Character. One of "ELE", "SEC", or "ELE/SEC".}
  \item{project_type}{Character. One of: "New Construction", "Addition", "Retrofit", "Purchase", "Demolition", or "Other".}
  \item{scope_otg_added}{Numeric. Number of pupil places being added.}
  \item{scope_cc_spaces_added}{Numeric. Number of licensed child care spaces being added.}
  \item{project_name}{Character. Name of the project. Trailing " Addition" is removed automatically.}
  \item{project_category}{Character. E.g., "Accommodation Pressure", "FDK", "Condition", etc.}
  \item{location_city}{Character. Municipality where the project is located. Will be title-cased automatically.}
}}
}
\value{
A tibble with all original columns and a new column:
\describe{
  \item{description_e}{A formatted English project description string.}
}
}
\description{
Creates a descriptive English-language summary of a school capital project based on key inputs
such as project type, number of pupil places added, school panel, project name,
number of child care spaces added, and project category.
}
\details{
The function standardizes project summaries into a consistent format used in reporting
and communication materials. It also formats city names in title case and removes redundant
occurrences of the word "Addition" in project names (e.g., "Maple School Addition" becomes "Maple School").


Project names are sanitized by removing trailing " Addition" and collapsing extra spaces.
Internally uses helper functions to expand panel codes, construct description phrases,
append child care information, and provide project context by category and location.
