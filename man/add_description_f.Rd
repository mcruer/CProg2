  \item{panel}{Character. One of "ELE", "SEC", or "ELE/SEC".}
  \item{project_type}{Character. One of: "New Construction", "Addition", "Retrofit", "Purchase", "Demolition", or "Other".}

  \item{scope_cc_spaces_added}{Numeric. Number of licensed child care spaces being added.}
  \item{project_name}{Character. Name of the project (school/site). Trailing " Addition" is removed automatically.}
  \item{project_category}{Character. E.g., "Accommodation Pressure", "FDK", "Condition", "French Language Access", etc.}
  \item{location_city}{Character. Municipality where the project is located. Will be title-cased automatically.}
}}
}
\value{
A tibble with all original columns and a new column:
\describe{
  \item{description_f}{A formatted project description in French.}
}
}
\description{
Creates a French-language project summary based on project type, panel, pupil places added,
child care spaces, and project category. This function is designed for internal reporting
and generates standardized, grammatically correct descriptions in French.
}
\details{
Project names are sanitized by removing trailing " Addition" and collapsing extra spaces.
Internally uses helper functions to translate panel codes, construct project phrases,
append child care details, and contextualize the location.
